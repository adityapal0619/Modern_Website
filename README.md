# Modern_Website
This project demonstrates a minimalist, modern website built in one line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The design features a centered layout with a heading, description text, and an interactive button that triggers an alert. Using Flexbox for centering, a sleek button hover effect, and subtle shadows, this code achieves a clean, responsive look suitable for desktop and mobile screens. Ideal for quick prototypes or learning basic web styling and interactivity.
